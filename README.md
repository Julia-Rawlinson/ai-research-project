# Machine Learning Models for Sex Classification in Abalone

## Abstract 

In this project, the task was to predict the sex of abalones (categorized as Male, Female, and Infant) using various physical measurements. The PyCaret library was used to streamline the machine learning process, which included data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The dataset comprised numerical features such as 'Length', 'Diameter', 'Height', 'Whole_weight', 'Shucked_weight', 'Viscera_weight', 'Shell_weight', and 'Rings'. After careful experimentation with feature engineering and model selection, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) emerged as the best-performing model. The LDA model was chosen based on its superior performance metrics, which included accuracy and the ability to discriminate among the three classes effectively.
